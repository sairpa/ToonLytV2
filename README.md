# ToonLytV2ðŸŽ¨ðŸ“¸

## About: 
An Android application which helps you create pastiches and cartoonised images. *Pastiche* is basically an artistic work in a style that imitates that of another work or an artist. There are over 15+ style images available in this applciation. ToonLyt is currently available for all **Android Phones above** *Android 8.0 - Oreo*.
## Download for Android
Download the ToonLyt APK from the  [latest release](https://github.com/sairpa/ToonLytV2/releases).

## How it works:
This application basically uses one of the famous Machine Learning Techniques - *Neural Style Transfer* for Pastiche Creation. This works by selecting a Style image and Source Image, extracting the features from both the images separately, and finally rendering them into a single stylized image.

## Features:
- Has 15+ Style Images
- Save / Share Stylised Images
- Has a CPU/GPU switch for controlling time
- Has a Re Run Button to increase convenience
