# ToonLytV2ðŸŽ¨ðŸ“¸
## tl;dr: 
An Android app which helps you create pastiches and cartoonised images. You have access to 15+ style images. It is available for all **Android Phones above** *Android 8.0 - Oreo*
## Download for Android
Download the ToonLyt APK from the  [latest release](https://github.com/sairpa/ToonLytV2/releases).

## Intro:
An Android Application that uses the Machine Learning Technique - *Neural Style Transfer* for Pastiche Creation. This works by selecting a Style image and Source Image and finally generate stylized image.

## Features:
- Has 15+ Style Images
- Save / Share Stylised Images
- Has a CPU/GPU switch for controlling time
- Has a Re Run Button to increase convenience 

## Images:

## What's changed?
- UI made more easier and recognisable to use
- Added some visual elements to make it interesting

## Future Development:
- Include a GAN model to retain all input characteristics
